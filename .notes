canadians using Motus stations to track birds and display the data on ArcGIS
going onto nbatlas there is so much data that I can use! Currently I think I will put my 5 favourite birds on the map for the year 2022 and then possibly if I can work it out have that change over the years. Maybe show that I can manipulate data together, by adding links to the data provider and to the dataset.
