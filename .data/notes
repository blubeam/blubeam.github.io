Raw Data
https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/RawData/

canadians using Motus stations to track birds and display the data on ArcGIS
take data from nbnatalas, can take my top 5 birds and display them over a map of the uk over time.
The data can be combined with data scraped from the internet, (do it legitly...) the logo of the ones doing the servay (take from .ico file), link to website etc.

having a closer look at the record csv file there are some interesting data points
	Basis of record - Human or automated
	Dataset name - could provide link to dataset
	Data provider - name of org, create url from this

~~~pseudo code~~~
nbn_public_reg_url = https://registry.nbnatlas.org/public/show/
dataset_url = $1 + "Dataset ID"
data_prov_url = $1 + "Data provider ID"
merge data
???????
profit!
#TODO 	WORK OUT HOW TO MERGE FOR DIFFERENT SPECIES AND TIMES
	IMPORT INTO ARCMAP
